===== NOTES:

attack state - attack always interrupts true tile movement

baba and boulders
	- boulder hits on the 4th tick after the sound
	- shadow appears on the 2nd tick
	- ticks are sound > no shadow > small shadow > big shadow > bang
	- boulder graphics
		- falling rubble first tick
		- falling boulder
		- boulder breaking
		- handling boulder shadow + lightning shadow on the same tile
add croc and its attacks
	- 1 - mouth full, 2 - pot appear, 3-4 - pot fly, 5 - pot break, proj flying, 6&7 - flying, 8 - explosion, 9 apply dmg

	- 4 ticks per spit every time, 4 ticks until pop every time
	- 4 ticks from pop to player hitsplat on 0 & 2 path (3 to player 1 to hitsplat), 3 ticks from pop to hitting player on 4-6 path

===== TODO:

	- keris and spec button?
	
UI : 
	- options menu: set ambro doses, path levels for baba/zebak

graphics:
	- add a background? a basic dark grey one maybe?
	- add more diagonal broken tiles to make it look better?
	- add actual arrows instead of orbs, low prio

nice to haves/later development:
	- zebak path level/faster attacks
	- add latancy option - low prio
	- inventory screen/prayer screen switching for heals
	- prayer point draining and pots
	- loot you get if you win
	- prayer points with brews, restores, bugs, keris?
	- pausing with screenshot behind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNiLIX8jNOM - super low prio
	- challenge mode - low prayer, would req getting 1 ticking working
	- options for starting hp - 70ish, 99 base,116 brewed,125 ambrod
	- new options screen popup from other option screen "invos" - then put path options and such here
