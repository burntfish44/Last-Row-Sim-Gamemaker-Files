===== NOTES:


lightning numbers are fine. free tile analysis:

total  - 58 - 100%
0 diff - 9 - 16%
1 diff - 28 - 48%
2 diff - 14 - 24%
3 diff - 7  - 12%
if 0 diff, always a 1-3 diff as well 
4 diff always comes with a 0-2


attack state - attack always interrupts true tile movement
zebak
	tick# - action:
	1 - mouth full, 
	2 - mouth open & pot appear, 
	3&4 - pot flying up, 
	5 - pot break + projectile appear and starts flying, 
	6&7 - projectile flying, 
	8 - explosion on player (damage calculated vs prayer at the start of this tick), 
	9 apply dmg.
	A new pot/rock out of his mouth every 4 ticks regardless of path level
	Higher path level (4&6) makes his pot/rock explode 1 tick faster and projectile faster 
		(3 ticks from pot break to touching the player -> 2 ticks to player) 
baba and boulders
	- boulder hits on the 4th tick after the sound
	- shadow appears on the 2nd tick
	- ticks are sound > no shadow > small shadow > big shadow > bang
	- boulder graphics
		- falling rubble first tick
		- falling boulder
		- boulder breaking
		- handling boulder shadow + lightning shadow on the same tile
add croc and its attacks
	- 1 - mouth full, 2 - pot appear, 3-4 - pot fly, 5 - pot break, proj flying, 6&7 - flying, 8 - explosion, 9 apply dmg
	- seems ~66% to atk with previous
	- 4 ticks per spit every time, 4 ticks until pop every time
	- 4 ticks from pop to player hitsplat on 0 & 2 path (3 to player 1 to hitsplat), 3 ticks from pop to hitting player on 4-6 path
	- it attacks as soon as it can not when the player is hit

===== TODO:
	
add heal buttons
	- keris and spec button?
	
UI : 
	- options menu: set ambro doses, path levels for baba/zebak

graphics:
	- add a background? a basic dark grey one maybe?
	- add more diagonal broken tiles to make it look better?
	- add actual arrows instead of orbs, low prio

nice to haves/later development:
	- zebak path level/faster attacks
	- add latancy option - low prio
	- inventory screen/prayer screen switching for heals
	- prayer point draining and pots
	- loot you get if you win
	- prayer points with brews, restores, bugs, keris?
	- pausing with screenshot behind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNiLIX8jNOM - super low prio
	- challenge mode - low prayer, would req getting 1 ticking working
	- options for starting hp - 70ish, 99 base,116 brewed,125 ambrod
	- new options screen popup from other option screen "invos" - then put path options and such here
	- make a vid on the creation process? lol
	
	
	
Current prio:
	- lightning can only do one damage per cycle it seems!!!!!
	
	- re-analyze zebak, side by side vid compare sim and actual
		No boulder complaints so far
	
	
1.0.2 patch notes
	- added ctrl walk
	- added ping slider
	- baba spawns 0-2 ticks after lightning starts
